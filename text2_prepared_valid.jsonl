{"prompt":"Professional Identification is a type of social identification and is the sense of oneness individuals have with a profession (e.g. law, medicine) and the degree to which individuals define themselves as profession members. Professional identity consists of the individual's alignment of roles, responsibilities, values, and ethical standards to be consistent with practices accepted by their specific profession. Sources of professional identification Researchers have found that a desire for quality (rather than profits) is associated with professional identification. Organizations tend to be concerned with efficiency and profitability, whereas professions care mainly about providing the highest-quality service (as defined by the professions), almost regardless of cost or revenue considerations (Freidson, 2001). Administrators are usually seen as promoting profitability at the expense of profession-defined quality (Freidson, 2001). In one notable study, practicing physicians viewed administrators with medical degrees (e.g., the M.D.) as “outsiders” to the medical profession because of what the physicians believed to be the administrators’ undue emphasis on organizational goals (Hoff, 1999: 336). Practicing physicians viewed administrators with MDs more negatively than those without MDs because the former were thought to have “betrayed” the medical profession by assuming administrative roles (Hoff, 1999: 344). ->","completion":" 1"}

Originally appearing in the closing scene of the show's 2006 series and as a special guest star in its following Christmas special, \"The Runaway Bride\", Tate was not expected to reprise her role as Donna; for series 3 (2007), the Doctor travelled alongside medical student Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman). However, Tate expressed interest in returning to the role, and she returned as Donna for the duration of series 4 (2008), and in a subsequent 2009–10 Christmas and New Year's special. Within the series' narrative, Donna begins as an outspoken Londoner in her mid-30s, a temp worker from Chiswick whose view of the universe is small in scope.

{"prompt":"Osemozotan (MKC-242) is a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist with some functional selectivity, acting as a full agonist at presynaptic and a partial agonist at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. 5-HT1A receptor stimulation influences the release of various neurotransmitters including serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. 5-HT1A receptors are inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor. Osemozotan has antidepressant, anxiolytic, antiobsessional, serenic, and analgesic effects in animal studies, and is used to investigate the role of 5-HT1A receptors in modulating the release of dopamine and serotonin in the brain, and their involvement in addiction to abused stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine. Pharmacodynamics The target of Osemozotan is 5-HT1A receptors. This molecules bind with almost 1000 times greater affinity to 5-HT1A receptors than most other 5-HT, dopamine, or adrenergic receptors. With repeated exposure of Osemozotan at the 5-HT1A receptors, there seems to be no change in the number of receptors, which is not typically seen with pharmaceutical agonists. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"In medicine, the mean systemic pressure (mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP)) is defined as the mean pressure that exists in the circulatory system when there is no blood motion. A similar term, mean circulatory filling pressure, (MCFP) is defined as the mean pressure that exists in the combined circulatory system & pulmonary system when there is no blood motion. The value of MSP in animal experimental models is approximately 7 mm Hg. It is an indicator of how full the circulatory system is (i.e. the volume of blood in the system compared to the capacity of the system), and is influenced by the volume of circulating blood and the smooth muscle tone in the walls of the venous system (which determines the capacity of the system). MSP is measured in two ways experimentally, and as a result has two alternative naming conventions. MSFP is measured after clamping the aortic root and the great veins at point of entry to right atrium. On the other hand, MCFP is measured experimentally by briefly inducing cardiac arrest or naturally during cardiac arrest once the blood redistributes. It may also be estimated in vivo using a series of inspiratory holds when a patient is on a mechanical ventilator. It can be used to demonstrate effects of drugs on the venous tone while the circulating blood volume remains constant, or to measure haemodynamic changes during haemorrhage. ->","completion":" 1"}

The guidelines followed at the deferred inspection site are largely the same as those followed by the officers at the port of entry, and are described in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Inspector's Field Manual. Aliens do not accrue unlawful presence between the time of arrival and the date of deferred inspection, but they do begin to accrue unlawful presence after their parole ends, if they are not successfully admitted at the deferred inspection site by then. The officers at both the port of entry and the deferred inspection site are part of the CBP Office of Field Operations. Decision at the port of entry to use deferred inspection ->","completion":" 1"}

The type and only known species is Cretacladoides imperator, which was discovered by Argentine paleontologist Alejandro Kappelman and his colleagues in La Rioja Province, Argentina in 2011. The specimen consists of a partial skeleton including the skull, mandible, and spinal column. The describers assigned it to the Tyrannosauridae, and named it after the Latin word for \"emperor\", \"imperator\". Cretacladoides is a small tyrannosauroid, measuring at in length. The holotype specimen has a long snout and small eyes. The teeth are fused into a single jagged blade in the upper jaw, similar to those of other tyrannosauroids such as Tarbosaurus and Albertosaurus. The lower jaw is much more primitive, with smaller teeth that may have been used for feedings on vegetation. The skeleton is heavily damaged, hindering determination of many anatomical details. It is currently assumed that Cretacladoides was a herbivore, based on the large size of its teeth and the fact that other tyrannosauroids were also herbivores at this time.

The street forms the main eastern length of the Royal Mile while the district is the main eastern section of Edinburgh's Old Town.

The burgh of Canongate that developed was controlled by the Abbey until the Scottish Reformation when it came under secular control. In 1636 the adjacent city of Edinburgh bought the feudal superiority of the Canongate but it remained a semi-autonomous burgh under its own administration of bailies chosen by Edinburgh magistrates, until its formal incorporation into the city in 1856. The burgh gained its name from the route that the canons of Holyrood Abbey took to Edinburgh - the canons' way or the canons' gait, from the Scots word gait meaning \"way\".

Early in that period, Anatolia was divided into several Iron Age kingdoms, most notably Lydia in the west, Phrygia in the center and Urartu in the east.

In the aftermath of the Greco-Persian Wars, all of Anatolia remained under Persian control except for the Aegean coast, which was incorporated in the Delian League in the 470s BC. Alexander the Great finally wrested control of the whole region from Persia in the 330s BC. After Alexander's death, his conquests were split amongst several of his trusted generals, but were under constant threat of invasion from both the Gauls and other powerful rulers in Pergamon, Pontus, and Egypt. The Seleucid Empire, the largest of Alexander's territories, and which included Anatolia, became involved in a disastrous war with Rome culminating in the battles of Thermopylae and Magnesia. The resulting Treaty of Apamea in (188 BC) saw the Seleucids retreat from Anatolia.

{"prompt":"Hydroelectricity is a critical source of electricity in Turkey. The country has the third-largest hydroelectric capacity in the world, after China and Brazil. Although hydroelectricity was first developed in Turkey in the late 19th century, the country’s modern hydroelectric industry began in the 1920s. At that time, the Turkish government commissioned a number of large hydroelectric projects, most notably the Southeastern Anatolian Project (Gölcük-Kırıkkale) and the Marmara-Brak Lake Project (Çam-Köyü). Despite this early investment, hydroelectricity played a relatively limited role in Turkey’s economy until the early 1960s. That year, however, a series of large dam projects—the Keban Dam (Keban), the Akkuyu Dam (Akkuyu), and the Ilisu Dam (Ilisu)—were completed, significantly enhancing hydroelectricity’s role in Turkey’s energy portfolio. Today, hydroelectricity provides more than half of Turkey’s total electricity generation. The country’s ongoing investment in hydroelectricity is reflected in its impressive installed capacity. As of 2017, Turkey had a total installed capacity of 37,692 megawatts (MW), ranking third in the world behind China and Brazil. This impressive capacity is primarily attributable to two large dam projects completed in recent years: the Gideaş Dam (Gide ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Xenocatabolism is a concept in medical bioremediation that refers to the use of xenobiotics in the treatment of environmental pollutants. Xenocatabolism has been used for the treatment of environmental pollutants for over two decades. The first use of xenocatabolism in the treatment of environmental pollutants was in the 1980s when researchers discovered that the fungus Aspergillus niger can break down chemicals such as benzo(a)pyrene. Since then, xenocatabolism has been used to treat a variety of other environmental pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, and chemical warfare agents. Xenocatabolism is a unique approach to treating environmental pollutants because it uses natural products to degrade or neutralize chemical compounds. Unlike traditional bioremediation methods, which rely on artificial chemicals to break down environmental pollutants, xenocatabolism uses naturally occurring compounds to do the job. This is because natural products are more resistant to degradation by environmental bacteria and enzymes. Xenocatabolism is also advantageous because it is non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Unlike traditional bioremediation methods, which often produce hazardous byproducts, xenocatabolism uses benign chemicals that are easily disposed of. Additionally, xenocatabolism is fast and efficient, meaning it can quickly degrade large quantities of environmental contaminants. Despite its advantages, xenocatabolism has yet to be widely adopted because it is not always available ->","completion":" 0"}

The offensive was intended to outflank and seize the German-occupied city of Caen, an important Allied objective, in the early stages of Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of north-west Europe. Preceded by Operation Martlet to secure the right flank of the advance, Operation Epsom began early on 26 June, with units of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division advancing behind a rolling artillery barrage. Air cover was sporadic for much of the operation, because poor weather in England forced the last-minute cancellation of bomber support. Accompanied by the 31st Tank Brigade, the 15th (Scottish) Division made steady progress and by the end of the first day had overrun much of the German outpost line, although some difficulties remained in securing the flanks. In mutually-costly fighting over the following two days, a foothold was secured across the River Odon and efforts were made to expand this, by capturing tactically valuable points around the salient and moving up the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. By 30 June, after German counter-attacks, some of the British forces across the river were withdrawn and the captured ground consolidated, bringing the operation to a close. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"A Group (previously cultivar-group) is a formal category in the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP) used for cultivated plants (cultivars) that share a defined characteristic. It is represented in a botanical name by the symbol Group or Gp. \"Group\" or \"Gp\" is always written with a capital G in a botanical name, or epithet. The Group is not italicized in a plant's name. The ICNCP introduced the term and symbol \"Group\" in 2004, as a replacement for the lengthy and hyphenated \"cultivar-group\", which had previously been the category's name since 1969. For the old name \"cultivar-group\", the non-standard abbreviation cv. group or cv. Group is also sometimes encountered. There is a slight difference in meaning, since a cultivar-group was defined to comprise cultivars, whereas a Group may include individual plants. The ICNCP distinguishes between the terms \"group\" and \"Group\", a \"group\" being \"an informal taxon not recognized in the ICBN\", while a \"Group\" is the formal taxon defined by the ICNCP (see above). ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"Bloom is a test to measure the reading comprehension of adolescents. It consists of a series of short questions and is designed to measure the ability to understand complex text. The Bloom test was developed in the late 1970s by Dr. Sandra Bloom and her colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles. The Bloom test is currently the most commonly used adolescent reading comprehension test in the United States. The Bloom test is divided into three parts: the reading selection section, the reading comprehension section, and the writing section. The reading selection section consists of 20 questions that ask students to read a passage about a flower and answer questions about it. The reading comprehension section asks students to read a passage about a car and answer questions about it. The writing section asks students to write a essay about their favorite flower. The Bloom test has been shown to be a reliable measure of adolescent reading comprehension. It has been found to be sensitive to changes in student reading level and has been used to assess reading comprehension skills across diverse populations of students, including low-income students, minority students, and students with disabilities. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"\"Bangun Pemudi Pemuda\" is an Indonesian patriotic song which was created by Alfred Simanjuntak, and to this day the song is still echoed, as in every celebration of Independence on 17 August and Youth Pledge on 28 October.

Simanjuntak argued that the people of Indonesia needed to experience a nascent spirit of patriotism, instead of just the six classes at the SRSI. The song's title (Pemudi-Pemuda, lit. Female Youth-Male Youth) was derived from the fact that several European languages use the fixed order of \"ladies and gentlemen\", incl. Dutch, and that inspired Simanjuntak to put a Pemudi in front of the Pemuda (usually the only term used in Indonesian for 'youth'.) Simanjuntak was put on a hit list by the Japanese military police as a direct result of this song, but it was never carried out, and he discovered the fact after independence. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"In financial accounting, a liability is defined as an obligation of a financial entity, such as a company, government, or individual, to pay a future financial obligation. Liabilities are measured at fair value and reported in the balance sheet. A liability may be classified according to its maturity date or the type of creditor to which it is owed. Long-term liabilities are those that will be settled in more than one year. Current liabilities are those that must be settled within one year. Short-term liabilities are those that will be settled within one month. Liabilities can also be classified according to the risk they pose to the financial entity. Financial entities may choose to classify liabilities into categories based on their level of risk. High-risk liabilities are those that pose a greater risk of not being paid, such as accounts receivable from customers who cannot or will not pay on time. Low-risk liabilities are those that pose a lower risk of not being paid, such as short-term debt. Financial entities must balance their liabilities against their assets to ensure that they have enough money available to pay all of their obligations when they fall due. If too much money is owed on the liabilities side of the ledger, the financial entity may need to borrow money from other lenders to meet its obligations. If too little money is available to cover the liabilities, the financial entity may have to sell assets or take out loans in order to raise cash. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Chloride channel accessory 3, also known as CLCA3, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CLCA3 gene. Chloride channel accessory 3 (CLCA3) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CLCA3 gene. CLCA3 is a chloride channel accessory protein that functions in the body to control chloride ions fluxes through cell membranes. This protein is also known as the \"calcium-release channel accessory 3\" or \"calcium-release channel auxiliary 3\". CLCA3 belongs to the family of proteins that are known as chloride channel accessory proteins. These proteins are responsible for controlling the flux of chloride ions through cell membranes. The function of CLCA3 is to allow calcium ions to pass through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm. This allows cells to regulate their calcium levels and perform other important functions. CLCA3 is located on the outer surface of the plasma membrane and interacts with other proteins that are involved in regulating chloride fluxes through cell membranes. This interaction allows CLCA3 to function properly and control calcium levels in cells. CLCA3 is expressed in various tissues throughout the body, including the brain, heart, and kidney. The role of CLCA3 in these tissues is not well understood, but it may play a role in regulating calcium levels or performing other important tasks. CLCA3 has been shown to be associated with various diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Studies suggest ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Within the field of anthropology and other social sciences, ethnography is a form of research that relies on a range of sources of data, but usually tends to rely mainly on participant observation. However, the term also refers to the product of this type of research, which of course normally takes a textual form. As a result, ethnography is also sometimes seen as a genre of writing, one used to describe patterns of human social interaction in particular contexts. Within the context of ethnography, the term 'realism' is often used to refer to the assumptions that some kinds of ethnographic work make about the phenomena to be investigated, and how these are to be understood. However, 'ethnographic realism' has also been used to refer to a style of writing that narrates the author's experiences and observations as if the reader were witnessing or experiencing events first hand.

{"prompt":"Marvel Cave is a National Natural Landmark located just west of Branson, Missouri, on top of Roark Mountain in Stone County. The cave was known by the Osage Indians in the early 16th century, after a tribe member fell through the cave's main entrance, a sinkhole. There is evidence that in 1541 the Spanish explored the cave, but the first recorded expedition was in 1869, led by Henry T. Blow. The unofficial Stone County chapter of Bald Knobbers, a local group of vigilantes, were rumored to have taken people to the top of Roark Mountain, and thrown them in the sink hole. Marvel Cave was originally called Marble Cave, after explorers in 1882 saw what they thought was marble on the cave's ceiling. This started the Marble Cave Mining Company, although later it was realized that there was never any marble in the cave. The Marble Cave Mining Company ceased all operations after only four and a half years. William Lynch purchased the cave in 1889, and soon after opened the cave to the public. In 1950, Hugo Herschend leased the cave for 99 years. The Herschends made renovations to the cave, and later opened a theme park, Silver Dollar City, on the surface above the cave. Marvel Cave is known for being one of the largest caves in Missouri, having one of the largest cave entry rooms (the Cathedral Room) of any cave in North America, and for being one of the longest running tourist attractions in the Ozarks. ->","completion":" 1"}

The Ancient Greeks gave the name Scythia (or Great Scythia) to all the lands northeast of Europe and the northern coast of the Black Sea. During the Iron Age, the region saw the flourishing of Scythian cultures. The Scythians—the Greeks' name for this initially nomadic people—inhabited Scythia from at least the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. In the seventh century BC, the Scythians controlled large swaths of territory throughout Eurasia, from the Black Sea across Siberia to the borders of East Asia. Its location and extent varied over time, but it usually extended farther to the west and significantly farther to the east than is indicated on the map. Some sources document that the Scythians were energetic but peaceful people. Not much is known about them. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"The organizing model, as the term refers to trade unions (and sometimes other social-movement organizations), is a broad conception of how those organizations should recruit, operate, and advance the interests of their members, though the specific functions of the model are more detailed and are discussed at length below. It typically involves many full-time organizers, who work by building up confidence and strong networks and leaders within the workforce, and by confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. The organizing model is strongly linked to social movement unionism and community unionism. The organizing model contributes to the discussion of how trade unions can reverse the trend of declining membership, which they are experiencing in most industrial nations, and how they can recapture some of the political power, which the labor movement has lost over the past century. The organizing model is frequently compared and contrasted with other methods of union organization, such as the servicing model. There is disagreement as to the logistics of applying the organizing model and whether it should focus on organizing existing members, recruiting new members, or both. The prominence of the model and the debate over its worth are seen primarily in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"An indoor positioning system (IPS) is a wireless local area network (WLAN) technology that uses an adjustable antenna to determine the location of a user indoors. IPS systems are used in commercial and residential environments to provide location information for applications such as real-time mapping, indoor navigation, and social networking. IPS systems use two primary methods to determine a user's location: triangulation and time of flight (ToF). Triangulation uses the geometrical properties of walls and objects in the environment to calculate a user's position. ToF uses the time it takes for a radio wave to travel between two points and calculate a user's distance. IPS systems can be divided into three categories based on how they collect location data: peer-to-peer, client-server, and centralized. Peer-to-peer IPS systems use multiple users' devices to share location data. Client-server IPS systems use one device to collect and store all the location data. Centralized IPS systems use a server to collect and store all the location data. IPS systems are commonly used in commercial buildings, such as airports, hospitals, shopping malls, and schools. They are also used in residential buildings, such as homes, apartments, and condominiums. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"The performative interval in sociology refers to the ways in which people use language to accomplish specific social or political goals. These goals can be anything from persuading others to do something, to asserting one's own dominance. Performative communication is the use of language to create a specific social or political effect. This effect can be anything from convincing a reluctant listener that something is true, to asserting one's own power. The performative may be used for a variety of reasons, some of which are outlined below. One reason the performative may be used is to create a sense of reality. When someone says \"I promise,\" they are using the performative to make sure that the listener understands that what they are saying is real. This is often done in situations where there is a risk of deception, such as when a doctor is giving a patient bad news. By using the performative, the doctor is making sure that the listener understands that what they are hearing is not just their opinion, but actual fact. Another reason the performative may be used is to create a sense of urgency. When someone says \"I order you to leave,\" they are using the performative to make sure that the listener understands that there is urgency involved in what they are asking. This is often done in situations where there is a risk of conflict, such as when an authority figure is telling someone who does not have any authority to leave.

{"prompt":"The ATI Wonder series represents some of the first video card add-on products for IBM Personal Computers and compatibles introduced by ATI Technologies in the mid to late 1980s. These cards were unique at the time as they offered the end user a considerable amount of value by combining support for multiple graphics standards (and monitors) into a single card. The VGA Wonder series added additional value with the inclusion of a bus mouse port, which normally required the installation of a dedicated Microsoft Mouse adapter. The VGA Wonder series later merged with the ATI Mach series of cards in 1990. The ATI Graphics Ultra (VRAM) and ATI Graphics Vantage (DRAM) cards both featured independent VGA Wonder ASICs in addition to their Mach8 8514 compatible graphics processor.
