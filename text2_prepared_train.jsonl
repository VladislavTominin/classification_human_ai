Trade in the Indian Ocean at the time of first colonization of Madagascar was dominated by large ships, called Djong, coming from Java and Sumatra.

{"prompt":"Culture consists of both material culture and non-material culture. Non-material culture refers to all aspects of human life that are not directly related to the physical world, such as beliefs, values, institutions, and artifacts. Culture can be thought of as a set of shared norms and values that define the way people behave. It can also be seen as the totality of the ways in which people interact with each other and their environment. Non-material culture includes everything from traditional clothing to folk music to cooking techniques. It can be found in every corner of the world, and it often has a unique and distinct flavor. Culture is important because it helps to shape the way we think and act. It can also help to create a sense of identity for communities and nations. Non-material culture is often undervalued, but it is vitally important for the preservation of human history and culture. It is crucial that we learn more about this fascinating aspect of human life so that we can continue to enjoy it in the future! ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Animal sexual behaviour takes many different forms, from simple courtship rituals between animals of the same sex, to complex homosexual and bisexual behaviours. Some animals may have more than one form of sexual behaviour, and some may engage in sexual activities for reasons other than reproduction. Sexual behaviour can be a means of establishing or maintaining social relationships, competing for resources or mates, or satisfying individual desires. Animal sexual behaviour has been observed in a variety of species across the animal kingdom, from insects to large mammals. Some species display a great deal of sexual variation, with different populations of animals exhibiting differing levels of sexual activity. The study of animal sexual behaviour is an important tool for understanding the biology and evolution of sexuality, as well as the social dynamics of animal populations. It can also provide insights into human sexuality, since many animal behaviours are similar to those exhibited by humans. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Theodore Christian Schneirla (July 23, 1902, Bay City, Michigan — Aug. 20, 1968, New York, N.Y.) was an American animal psychologist who performed some of the first studies on the behavior patterns of army ants. Schneirla was educated at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (M.S., 1925; Sc.D., 1928), and joined the staff of New York University in 1928. He made the first of eight trips to the Barro Colorado Island, Panama Canal Zone, to study the behavior of army ants in 1932. His “Studies on Army Ants in Panama,” published the next year, provided new insight into their behavior. He discovered that these ants operate on a 36-day cycle consisting of a 16-day nomadic pattern followed by a 20-day stationary phase. In 1934 he reported that ants follow a particular pattern when moving into new territory and that raids by these insects peak once during the morning and again in the afternoon. Sudden changes in weather also were found to give rise to sudden bursts of activity. In 1944 he showed that their raids were caused by the level of excitability of the ant colony and not by a scarcity of prey. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"Mussa Moloh (born in the mid to late 1800s) is regarded as the last king of the Fuladu kingdom in the Senegambia region of Africa. Moloh was known to work with colonial powers to keep power and thwart rebellions; this would later lead to his downfall. The Fulbe Empire The Fuladu kingdom was founded, born of rebellion led by Mussa Moloh’s father, Moloh Eggue, also known as Alfa Moloh, against the Mandinka who formerly ruled the Gambia region. Those Mandingo rulers who once owned the land now the Fulbe state remained inside the kingdom once belonging to them. The scape of this empire in demographical terms was wide and diverse, despite the Fulbes being generally regarded as a homogenous group. Being a diverse group ultimately led to cultural struggles of power leading Alfa Moloh to quarrel with some groups causing these groups to leave the Fulbe state. The core of Alfa’s following was the Fulbe Firdu. Consisting of roughly 30,000, the Firdu moved north to make permanent settlements in Tomari and Jimana, two of the former Mandingo kingdoms in the Gambia valley. Later, the Fulbe empire would turn into a state directly resulting from the efforts of Alfa’s son, Mussa Moloh. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"A full-time job is employment in which a person works a minimum number of hours defined as such by their employer. Overview Full-time employment often comes with benefits that are not typically offered to part-time, temporary, or flexible workers, such as annual leave, sick leave, and health insurance. Part-time jobs are mistakenly thought by some to not be careers. However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by the employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 32 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits. ->","completion":" 1"}

As with other members of this virus family, PeMoV is a flexuous filamentous virus with particles 740–750 nm long. It is transmitted by several species of aphids and by mechanical inoculation. It was first given its name in 1965 when it was isolated from peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) in Georgia, United States. The virus was found to be seed transmitted in its host. Host species Besides peanuts, the virus is known to infect soybeans (Glycine max), French beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), peas (Pisum sativum), and various weed species of Cassia.

{"prompt":"The Talgai Skull is a human fossil found on the Talgai Station, near Allora, Southern Downs Region, Queensland, Australia. It has been dated indirectly, based on the radiocarbon date of a carbonate nodule found in stratigraphic proximity, at 13,500 years old. History The Talgai Skull was discovered in 1886 on Talgai Homestead, as the first fossil evidence of early human occupation in the area. It was found by fencing contractor, William Naish. It had been embedded in the wall of Dalrymple Creek, which had been scoured out by heavy rain. In 1896 the skull was sent to Sydney where it was examined by the trustees of the Australian Museum. The museum was interested in purchasing the fossil but could not agree on an acceptable price. Eventually the skull was returned to its owner. It remained at the homestead until 1914 when Professor Edgeworth David, Professor of Archaeology at Sydney University visited Talgai and presented a theory that the skull was 20,000 years old and provided a \"missing link\" in the evolutionary chain. This sudden change in attitude towards the skull was motivated in part by the recent \"discovery\" of the Piltdown man fossils in England. Although later proven to be hoax, the Piltdown find encouraged others to search for similar evidence of early man.

{"prompt":"Domenico di Zanobi, formerly known as the Master of the Johnson Nativity, was an Italian Renaissance painter. His exact dates of birth and death are not known. He is documented as a mature artist from 1467 until 1481. Domenico di Zanobi's paintings were first grouped together in 1966 by the American art historian Everett Fahy, who recognized about two dozen paintings in a similar style. Since none of these paintings are signed, Fahy named their artist the \"Master of the Johnson Nativity,\" after the panel of the Nativity in the Johnson Collection at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1996, the Florentine scholar Annamaria Bernacchioni identified this artist as Domenico di Zanobi, a documented assistant of Filippo Lippi in Florence and Prato, based on her discovery of the carpenter's bill for the Coronation of the Virgin at the Museo della Misericordia in San Miniato. This painting, attributed by Fahy to the Master of the Johnson Nativity, was reportedly commissioned by the Chellini family in 1476 from a painter named \"Domenico.\" Since the painting is clearly not by Domenico di Michelino, who also worked for the Chellini family, Bernacchioni suggest that it's by Domenico di Zanobi, who shared a workshop with Domenico di Michelino in Florence's Via delle Terme by 1467. The identification has since found acceptance among art historians. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"Utopian socialism is the term often used to describe a type of social and political theory and practice that advocates the establishment of a society in which all people would be equal and live in happiness and harmony. Utopian socialism is a type of social and political theory and practice that advocates the establishment of a society in which all people would be equal and live in happiness and harmony. The term was first used in the early 19th century to describe societies that were based on the principles of equality, fraternity, and liberty. Utopian socialists often envisioned an egalitarian society in which all people would share in common the fruits of their labor. They believed that through the development of democratic institutions, society could be transformed into a paradise where humans could live in peace and harmony. The utopian socialists were not the only ones to advance this idea. Many philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, Thomas More, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, had also argued for the need for a society based on principles of justice and equality. However, it was the utopian socialists who developed this idea into a coherent theory.

{"prompt":"Aprey Faïence is a name used for the painted, tin-glazed faience pottery produced at a glass-works at Aprey, France. This factory was established in 1744 by Jacques Lallemont de Villehaut, the Baron d'Aprey, on his estate. In 1760 he partnered with his brother Joseph, and the two hired Protaix Pidoux, a Swiss pottery painter. Jacques withdrew from business in 1769, so Joseph hired François Ollivier, a potter. Ollivier became director from 1774–1792. The factory came under the ownership of the Baron d'Anthès de Longpierre in 1789, then closed in 1885.

The high quality of the work produced at this factory, along with the bird illustrations by the chief painter, made these pieces a preference of collectors. Early works did not have a distinct marking. Later pottery was of a lower quality, and these inferior pieces were typically marked with an A.P. symbol and the initials of the painter. ->","completion":" 1"}

With the sunshine beaming this week and some of the highest temperatures recorded so far this year , what better moment to splash out on the new third-generation Audi TT Roadster . It goes on sale this month . Just the time to get the roof off on this softtop German sports car , which has established itself as a firm favourite in the 16 years it has been on the road . I drove the fully stocked four-wheel-drive 2-litre TFSI in S-line quattro trim with 230 bhp , which was adept at whipping around the Cotswolds in style . Sure-footed and fun to drive with lively acceleration that takes it from rest to 62 mph in just 6.1 seconds up to a top speed electronically limited to 155 mph . CO2 emissions are a fair 154g\/km . Supportively cossetting sports seats leave you sitting comfortably at the wheel . A nicely tuned exhaust pipe gives the TT Roadster a most satisfying ` brrrm brrrm ' . You wo n't break the bank at the filling station . Even with the satisfying performance you 'll average 43.5 mpg , rising to 52.3 mpg when cruising and still managing a respectable 33.6 mpg around town . Great wind-in-the-hair motoring with a top that will come down in ten seconds at speeds of up to 31mph , and a more streamlined body . It 's easy to make a hands-free phone call with the automatic three-layer fabric hood down because microphones are embedded in the safety belt . Auto-dim LED headlights have been transferred across from the flagship Audi A8 saloon . If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . Though this version is on an allnew platform , the progression is evolution , not revolution . The car I drove cost well in excess of £ 50,000 . The range starts from £ 31,995 for the 2-litre TDi Sport in six-speed manual . The optional open-top driving package includes head-level heating to keep your bonce from getting chilly , an electrically operated wind deflector , which stops parky draughts whistling behind your neck , and handily heated super sports seats . No matter how good , nothing will have the jaw-dropping impact on the car market as the original Audi TT of 1999 . It was dubbed the ` Bauhaus Bullet ' because of its clean , minimalist lines reminiscent of the German art movement of the Twenties and early Thirties . Hefty prestige price tag . The base price of the car I drove was £ 41,630 . But it was loaded up with extras adding another £ 13,000 -- or the price of a half-decent family runaround .

Calcium signaling is essential for a wide variety of biological processes, from muscle contraction to nerve impulse transmission. Calcium ions are abundant in the body and are found in all cells. Calcium ions are present in the cytoplasm and play an important role in cellular function by contributing to the stability of cellular structures, including the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton. In addition, calcium ions are needed for the activation of voltage-gated ion channels. Calcium signaling is essential for a wide variety of biological processes, from muscle contraction to nerve impulse transmission. There are two main types of calcium: calcium ionized (Ca2+) and calcium un ionized (Ca+). Ca2+ is more abundant than Ca+ and is responsible for most of the cellular action that is mediated by calcium. Ca2+ can enter cells through several pathways, including diffusion across cell membranes, uptake by endocytosis or exocytosis, and release from intracellular stores. Once inside cells, Ca2+ can bind to proteins or other molecules to form complexes that control cellular functions. One important role of Ca2+ in cells is its role in controlling gene expression. When cells need to produce certain proteins or enzymes, they need to activate specific genes. Calcium ions help to ->","completion":" 0"}
{"prompt":"In computer science, formal specifications are mathematically based techniques whose purpose are to help with the implementation of systems and software. They are used to describe a system, to analyze its behavior, and to aid in its design by verifying key properties of interest through rigorous and effective reasoning tools. These specifications are formal in the sense that they have a syntax, their semantics fall within one domain, and they are able to be used to infer useful information. Motivation In each passing decade, computer systems have become increasingly more powerful and, as a result, they have become more impactful to society. Because of this, better techniques are needed to assist in the design and implementation of reliable software.

{"prompt":"The L-arabinose operon, also called the ara or araBAD operon''', is an operon required for the breakdown of the five-carbon sugar L-arabinose in Escherichia coli. The L-arabinose operon contains three structural genes: araB, araA, araD (collectively known as araBAD), which encode for three metabolic enzymes that are required for the metabolism of L-arabinose. AraB (ribulokinase), AraA (an isomerase), AraD (an epimerase) produced by these genes catalyse conversion of L-arabinose to an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway, D-xylulose-5-phosphate. The structural genes of the L-arabinose operon are transcribed from a common promoter into a single transcript, a mRNA. The expression of the L-arabinose operon is controlled as a single unit by the product of regulatory gene araC and the catabolite activator protein (CAP)-cAMP complex. The regulator protein AraC is sensitive to the level of arabinose and plays a dual role as both an activator in the presence of arabinose and a repressor in the absence of arabinose to regulate the expression of araBAD. AraC protein not only controls the expression of araBAD but also auto-regulates its own expression at high AraC levels. ->","completion":" 1"}

The police found cocaine and cash in Hudson's car, and charged him with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He moved to suppress the evidence, but the trial court ruled in favor of the prosecution. The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed, and Hudson was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

{"prompt":"Front running, also known as tailgating, is the prohibited practice of entering into an equity (stock) trade, option, futures contract, derivative, or security-based swap to capitalize on advance, nonpublic knowledge of a large (\"block\") pending transaction that will influence the price of the underlying security. In essence, it means the practice of engaging in a Personal Securities Transaction in advance of a transaction in the same security for a client's account. Front running is considered a form of market manipulation in many markets. Cases typically involve individual brokers or brokerage firms trading stock in and out of undisclosed, unmonitored accounts of relatives or confederates. Institutional and individual investors may also commit a front running violation when they are privy to inside information. A front running firm either buys for its own account before filling customer buy orders that drive up the price, or sells for its own account before filling customer sell orders that drive down the price. Front running is prohibited since the front-runner profits from nonpublic information, at the expense of its own customers, the block trade, or the public market. In 2003, several hedge fund and mutual fund companies became embroiled in an illegal late trading scandal made public by a complaint against Bank of America brought by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.

{"prompt":"Pancharatra (IAST: Pāñcarātra) was a religious movement in Hinduism that originated in late 3rd-century BCE around the ideas of Narayana and the various avatars of Vishnu as their central deities. The movement later merged with the ancient Bhagavata tradition and contributed to the development of Vaishnavism. The Pancharatra movement created numerous literary treatises in Sanskrit called the Pancharatra Samhitas, and these have been influential Agamic texts within the theistic Vaishnava movements. Literally meaning five nights (pañca: five, rātra: nights), the term Pancharatra has been variously interpreted. The term has been attributed to a sage Narayana who performed a sacrifice for five nights and became a transcendent being and one with all beings. The Pancharatra Agamas constitute some of the most important texts of many Vaishnava philosophies including the Madhva Sampradaya or Brahma Sampradaya of Madhvacharya and the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya of Ramanuja.

{"prompt":"The Note Crisis was a political crisis in Soviet–Finnish relations in 1961. The Soviet Union sent Finland a diplomatic note on October 30, 1961, referring to the threat of war and West German militarization and proposing that Finland and the Soviet Union begin consultations on securing the defence of both countries, as provided for in the Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948. The note coincided with the detonation of the Tsar Bomba, the most powerful nuclear test in history, and followed close on the heels of the Berlin Crisis and Bay of Pigs Invasion. The note precipitated a crisis in Finland: activating the military provisions of the treaty would have frustrated Finland's post-war policy of neutrality in international affairs and greatly damaged Finland's relations with the West. One of the crucial goals of Finnish foreign policy was to reinforce the credibility of Finland's neutrality in the eyes of Western powers which were skeptical of the country's ability to resist Soviet influence. ->","completion":" 1"}

The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s: the oldest surviving charters granted land to the Church, but from the eighth century, surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to lay people. The term charter covers a range of written legal documentation, including diplomas, writs and wills. A diploma was a royal charter that granted rights over land or other privileges by the king, whereas a writ was an instruction (or prohibition) by the king which may have contained evidence of rights or privileges. Diplomas were usually written on parchment in Latin, but often contained sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The writ was authenticated by a seal and gradually replaced the diploma as evidence of land tenure during the late Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods.

{"prompt":"Youth unemployment is the situation of young people who are unemployed, underemployed, or employed in positions that do not meet their full potential. The unemployment rate for young people is twice the national average. Youth unemployment has been on the rise globally since the late 2000s and has reached crisis levels in many countries. There are several factors contributing to youth unemployment. Firstly, there is an increase in precarious employment, which often doesn't offer the same opportunities and benefits as regular, full-time jobs. Secondly, employers are often reluctant to hire young people because they believe they will not stay with the company for a long time. Thirdly, many young people do not have enough skills or education to find a job. Finally, there is a lack of vocational training and apprenticeship programmes available to young people. Youth unemployment is a major issue worldwide and there are many ways to combat it. Governments can invest in vocational training and apprenticeship programmes, create more secure employment opportunities, and provide support for young people during their job search. NGOs can also help to create awareness of the problem and provide resources for young people affected by it. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"The Guitar Concerto, W501 (piano reduction: W502), is a work for solo guitar and small orchestra written by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos in Rio de Janeiro in 1951. A performance lasts about 18 minutes. History The concerto was written for the Spanish guitarist Andrés Segovia, to whom the score is dedicated. Initially in three movements and titled Fantasia concertante, Villa-Lobos later added a cadenza at Segovia's request, and changed the title to Concerto for Guitar and Small Orchestra. According to another version of the story, the situation was quite the reverse: Segovia commissioned the work with the stipulation that there should be no cadenza and the work be titled Fantasia concertante. Villa-Lobos, however, ignored these demands, supplying an extended cadenza and insisting the work be called a concerto. The concerto was first performed on 6 February 1956 in Houston, Texas, by Andrés Segovia and the Houston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer. A reduction for guitar and piano was published in Paris by Max Eschig in 1955, who also published the full score in 1971. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"Pulse-density modulation, or PDM, is a form of modulation used to represent an analog signal with a binary signal. In a PDM signal, specific amplitude values are not encoded into codewords of pulses of different weight as they would be in pulse-code modulation (PCM); rather, the relative density of the pulses corresponds to the analog signal's amplitude. The output of a 1-bit DAC is the same as the PDM encoding of the signal. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a special case of PDM where the switching frequency is fixed and all the pulses corresponding to one sample are contiguous in the digital signal. For a 50% voltage with a resolution of 8-bits, a PWM waveform will turn on for 128 clock cycles and then off for the remaining 128 cycles. With PDM and the same clock rate the signal would alternate between on and off every other cycle. The average is 50% for both waveforms, but the PDM signal switches more often. For 100% or 0% level, they are the same.

The city has been ruled by a succession of sultans since its establishment in the 12th century as an outpost of the Maldivian Hindu Rajaateyya Dynasty.

Due to its importance in Portuguese music it likely arrived in Angola, Goa and Macau, and as far as Hawaii by the 19th century, where it became the forerunner of the ukulele. These early cordophones, the violas, had characteristics identical to the modern instruments, and great importance along the Iberian Peninsula, where it appeared in iconography, poems and diverse literature. The chronicler Gaspar Frutuoso, who identified it as just a \"Viola\", suggested that it first arrived in the Azores in the second half of the 19th century, brought the first settlers.

It is situated approximately four miles (6 km) east of the town of Guildford and about two miles (3 km) north of the town of Dorking. The Box Hill area has been settled since at least the Iron Age. The summit of Box Hill was the site of a large Iron Age hill fort known as Polygonum Cuspidatum, possibly defended by a wooden palisade. The fort and its surrounding ditches are still visible on aerial photographs. There is evidence that the hill fort was destroyed by fire in the early medieval period. The first recorded mention of Box Hill is in a document dating from 1086 which records that it was given to Westminster Abbey by Queen Matilda. In 1101, King Henry I granted a charter to the Priory of Box Hill which allowed it to hold a weekly market and mint its own coins. The priory was abolished during the Protestant Reformation but was re-established in 1539. Box Hill became a parish in 1849 and, from 1894, had its own civil parish council. The parish church, St John the Baptist, was built in 1853–54 and is a Grade II* listed building. In 1911, Box Hill became part of the new county of Surrey.

The raid was code-named Operation Crevice, and was based on the premise that an intact German garrison might still be in occupation of a fortified position, ready to resist any Allied assault. The target was the fortified town of Arnhem, in the Netherlands. The plan was for the 1st Airborne Division to seize the town's bridges and create a foothold from which to advance on the Germans' main stronghold, the city of Nijmegen. The operation began early on 18 September 1944, with an airborne drop into Arnhem. However, heavy resistance from the Germans quickly forced a withdrawal of the paratroopers to their Drop Zones. For two days, British and American troops attempted to regroup and mount another attack on Arnhem, but this too failed. On 20 September, General Horrocks issued orders for the 1st Airborne Division to retreat to England.

{"prompt":"Chaohusaurus is an extinct genus of basal ichthyopterygian, depending on definition possibly ichthyosaur, from the Early Triassic of Chaohu and Yuanan, China. Discovery  The type species Chaohusaurus geishanensis was named and described by Yang Zhongjian and Dong Zhiming in 1972, based on a fossil found during the construction of a railway. The generic name refers to lake Chao Hu. The specific name refers to the Geishan location. The holotype, IVPP V 4001, was uncovered in a layer of the Majianshan Limestone Formation dating from the Anisian. It consists of a partial skeleton, containing the skull and the front torso. In 1985 Chen Lizhu named two additional species based on fossils found in the same formation: Anhuisaurus chaoxianensis and Anhuisaurus faciles. However, the generic name had already been preoccupied by the lizard Anhuisaurus Hou 1974. Therefore, Anhuisaurus Chen 1985 was in 1991 renamed into Chensaurus by Jean-Michel Mazin e.a. In 1998, Ryosuke Motani e.a. established that the Chensaurus fossils represented remains of juveniles, with those of C. faciles being the youngest, and that these formed a growth series with Chaohusaurus. This implied that the known material of Chaohusaurus was increased with the specimens AGM P45-H85-25, the holotype of Chensaurus chaoxianensis; AGM P45-H85-25, the holotype of Chensaurus faciles; and the front flippers IVPP V 11361 and IVPP V 11362.

{"prompt":"Monism attributes oneness or singleness (Greek: μόνος) to any entity or concept, including individual beings, objects, and ideas. Monism is the philosophical position that attributes oneness or singleness to any entity or concept, including individual beings, objects, and ideas. This might be called \"unitary monism\" if it regards a single thing as the source of all existence or \"plural monism\" if it regards multiple things as being essentially equivalent. In both cases, the term \"monism\" is used pejoratively to suggest that the thinker in question poses thinking about entities and concepts in an insufficiently complex way. The history of the concept of monism is complex and has many different interpretations. One of the earliest recorded mentions of the idea comes from the 6th century BCE philosopher Parmenides, who argued that there is only one thing in the universe, which he named \"the One\". Parmenides's student Zeno of Elea also argued for monism, but in a more sophisticated way that has since been abandoned. Monism was popularised in the 3rd century BCE by Plato, who argued that there is only one kind of thing in the world: Forms. Forms are eternal and unchanging, and exist outside of time and space. Aristotle later refined Plato's idea by arguing that there are two types of monism: physical monism, which holds that there is only one kind of substance (e.g. soul, mind, matter), and logical monism, which holds ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Dictogloss is a language teaching technique that is used to teach grammatical structures, in which students form small groups and summarize a target-language text. First, the teacher prepares a text that contains examples of the grammatical form to be studied. The teacher reads the text to the students at normal speed while they take notes. Students then work in small groups to prepare a summary of their work using the correct grammatical structures, and finally each group presents their work to the rest of the class. Dictogloss activities encourage learners to focus on the form of their language while also being based in communication, and are used in task-based language teaching. Dictogloss activities have several advantages. They integrate the four language skills of listening, reading, speaking, and writing. They also give students opportunities to talk about both content and the language itself. Furthermore, dictogloss activities are a useful way of presenting new factual information to students and encourage them to listen for key points. Finally, they give support to less confident students, as they are encouraged to participate in their groups as part of the structure of the activity. ->","completion":" 1"}
{"prompt":"Action regulation theory (or Activity regulation theory) is a model of organizational behavior that postulates that individuals and groups regulate their behavior in order to maintain a desired level of activity within organizations. The model was first proposed by researchers at the University of Minnesota in the 1970s, and has been influential in the study of work and organizational behavior. The theory is based on the premise that organizations are dynamic systems that are constantly seeking to maintain a desired level of activity. This level of activity is typically determined by three factors: the level of customer demand, the amount of available resources, and the organization's ability to respond to customer demand. The theory is based on the assumption that individuals and groups regulate their behavior in order to maintain a desired level of activity within organizations. The model was first proposed by researchers at the University of Minnesota in the 1970s, and has been influential in the study of work and organizational behavior. The theory has been used to explain a wide range of phenomena, including employee motivation, performance management, team dynamics, communication patterns, and organizational change. It has also been used to develop a number of empirically based models for studying these phenomena. The theory has been criticized for its lack of empirical support, its reliance on static assumptions about the nature of organizations, and its failure to account for variation across organizations. However, the theory remains an important tool for studying organizational behavior and remains an important part of research on work and employee motivation ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Norwood Russell Hanson (August 17, 1924 – April 18, 1967) was an American philosopher of science. Hanson was a pioneer in advancing the argument that observation is theory-laden — that observation language and theory language are deeply interwoven — and that historical and contemporary comprehension are similarly deeply interwoven. His single most central intellectual concern was the comprehension and development of a logic of discovery. Work Hanson's best-known work is Patterns of Discovery (1958), in which he argues that what we see and perceive is not what our senses receive, but is instead filtered sensory information, where the filter is our existing preconceptions – a concept later called a 'thematic framework.' He cited optical illusions such as the famous old Parisienne woman (Patterns of Discovery, p. 11), which can be seen in different ways. Hanson drew a distinction between 'seeing as' and 'seeing that' which became a key idea in evolving theories of perception and meaning. He wanted to formulate a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used Charles Sanders Peirce's notion of abduction for this. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"In photometry, luminous energy is the perceived brightness of a light source. It is measured in candelas per square metre (cd\/m²). It is a measure of the total energy radiated by a light source in the visible or near-visible spectrum. Luminous energy is important because it affects how well we can see in low light conditions. For example, it is important for night time drivers and pedestrians to be able to see obstacles in the road, and for people working in dark offices. The brightness of a light source is determined by the total energy radiated by the light source. This includes both radiant energy, which is what is radiated from the light source itself, and non-radiant energy, which comes from the heat that is produced by the radiation of the light. There are several ways to measure luminous energy. One way is to use a luminometer, which is a device that measures the brightness of a light source in candelas per square metre (cd\/m²). Another way is to use a photometer, which measures the brightness of a light source in terms of photons per square metre (ppm). ->","completion":" 0"}

In 1327 he was solicitor of the episcopal court at Basle, and shortly after, while clerk to Bishop Berthold von Buchecke, held a similar position in Strasbourg.

The I.O.O.F.'s initial investment in the building was $100,000, and it paid off quickly; within a year, membership had increased from 2,000 to 8,000 members. The building's success led to an increase in membership and donations, and by 1925, the organization had outgrown its original building and purchased a site on North Clark Street for a new headquarters. Construction on the new building began in 1926 and was completed three years later; it cost $1 million dollars and was even more impressive than its predecessor, featuring a columned atrium with a fountain in its center and marble floors and walls throughout. Since 1983, the I.O.O.F.'s Centennial Building has served as the headquarters of the IBO (International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers), which moved into the building in 1984 after purchasing it from the I.O.O.F.; today, it is one of Chicago's most important labor unions. ->","completion":" 0"}

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 17, 2009. The episode title is a parody of the 1988 film Coming to America. The storyline is a pick on illegal immigration to the United States, complete with self-appointed vigilantes and building a fence to prevent it. Tying in with the episode's subject of Norwegian-descended settlers, its first US broadcast coincided with the Norwegian Constitution Day. Plot Krusty the Clown is informed that the Krusty Burger is the unhealthiest fast food in the world, so he decides that his namesake restaurant should serve the \"Mother Nature Burger\" which is entirely vegetarian. All of the townsfolks like the new burgers, but soon the entire town has food poisoning, traced to tainted barley caused by a rat that got caught in the grinder which was grown in the neighboring town of Ogdenville. The ensuing boycott destroys the local barley industry and the residents of Ogdenville, who are descended from Norwegian settlers and portrayed as overly stereotypical, are forced to abandon their town (to Norwegian romantic composer Edvard Grieg's mournful \"Aase's Death\", followed by a phrase from the Finlandia Hymn by his Finnish counterpart Jean Sibelius). ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"Sociocultural evolution, sociocultural evolutionism or cultural evolution are theories of sociobiology and cultural evolution that describe how societies and culture change over time. Whereas sociocultural development traces processes that tend to increase the complexity of a society or culture, sociocultural evolution also considers process that can lead to decreases in complexity (degeneration) or that can produce variation or proliferation without any seemingly significant changes in complexity (cladogenesis). Sociocultural evolution is \"the process by which structural reorganization is affected through time, eventually producing a form or structure which is qualitatively different from the ancestral form\". Most of the 19th-century and some 20th-century approaches to socioculture aimed to provide models for the evolution of humankind as a whole, arguing that different societies have reached different stages of social development. The most comprehensive attempt to develop a general theory of social evolution centering on the development of sociocultural systems, the work of Talcott Parsons (1902–1979), operated on a scale which included a theory of world history. Another attempt, on a less systematic scale, originated from the 1970s with the world-systems approach of Immanuel Wallerstein (1930-2019) and his followers.  More recent approaches focus on changes specific to individual societies and reject the idea that cultures differ primarily according to how far each one has moved along some presumed linear scale of social progress. Most modern archaeologists and cultural anthropologists work within the frameworks of neoevolutionism, sociobiology, and modernization theory. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"The world glyph sets are character repertoires of glyphs used in writing systems throughout the world. They are a subset of the world's writing systems, which also include logograms, syllabaries, and other scripts. The first world glyph set was developed in the 1940s by Danish linguist Otto Jespersen and is known as the Jespersen alphabet. It is a Latin alphabet with 24 letters, eight of which are vowels. The other 16 letters are based on features of the Latin letters that Jespersen believed were most likely to be found in world languages. The set includes a number of symbols that are not found in any other alphabet, including the letter æ (æ), which Jespersen based on the shape of the Latin letter c. Since its development, many world glyph sets have been created, each with its own unique set of characters. In 1998, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created a standard for world glyph sets called ISO 15924. This standard defines a framework for creating world glyph sets and provides guidelines for their design. The ISO 15924 standard is widely used to create world glyph sets for software applications and other digital products. Today, many world glyph sets are available online.

If issued in a small, standard credit card size form, it is usually called an identity card (IC, ID card, citizen card), or passport card. Some countries issue formal identity documents, as national identification cards which may be compulsory or non-compulsory, while others may require identity verification using regional identification or informal documents. When the identity document incorporates a person's photograph, it may be called photo ID. In the absence of a formal identity document, a driver's license may be accepted in many countries for identity verification. Some countries do not accept driver's licenses for identification, often because in those countries they do not expire as documents and can be old or easily forged.

{"prompt":"The semiconductor luminescence equations (SLEs) describe luminescence of semiconductors resulting from spontaneous recombination of electronic excitations, producing a flux of spontaneously emitted light. This description established the first step toward semiconductor quantum optics because the SLEs simultaneously includes the quantized light–matter interaction and the Coulomb-interaction coupling among electronic excitations within a semiconductor. The SLEs are one of the most accurate methods to describe light emission in semiconductors and they are suited for a systematic modeling of semiconductor emission ranging from excitonic luminescence to lasers. Due to randomness of the vacuum-field fluctuations, semiconductor luminescence is incoherent whereas the extensions of the SLEs include the possibility to study resonance fluorescence resulting from optical pumping with coherent laser light. At this level, one is often interested to control and access higher-order photon-correlation effects, distinct many-body states, as well as light–semiconductor entanglement. Such investigations are the basis of realizing and developing the field of quantum-optical spectroscopy which is a branch of quantum optics. ->","completion":" 1"}

Disjunctivism is a position in the philosophy of language that states that there are no linguistic units that are independent of one another. The term was coined by the philosopher David Lewis in his book Philosophical Papers. Disjunctivism is opposed to unitarianism, which holds that there are linguistic units, such as words or phrases, that are independent of one another and can be separated into distinct parts or categories. Disjunctivists argue that there is no such thing as a linguistic unit that is separate from other linguistic units and can be analyzed in isolation from them. According to disjunctivism, all linguistic units are interconnected and form a network or web of relationships. This network of relationships is constantly changing and evolving, and it cannot be reduced or analyzed in any way without destroying its complexity and integrity. Disjunctivists believe that this network of relationships is what gives language its unique and special properties. Disjunctivism has been controversial since it was first introduced, and many philosophers have argued against it. Some say that disjunctivism is too radical a position and does not allow for enough analysis and understanding of language. Others argue that disjunctivism does not actually explain or explain well how the network of relationships in language works. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Forensic entomology is the scientific study of the invasion of the succession pattern of arthropods with their developmental stages of different species found on the decomposed cadavers during legal investigations. It is the application and study of insect and other arthropod biology to criminal matters. It also involves the application of the study of arthropods, including insects, arachnids, centipedes, millipedes, and crustaceans to criminal or legal cases. It is primarily associated with death investigations; however, it may also be used to detect drugs and poisons, determine the location of an incident, and find the presence and time of the infliction of wounds. Forensic entomology can be divided into three subfields: urban, stored-product and medico-legal\/medico-criminal entomology. History Historically, there have been several accounts of applications for, and experimentation with, forensic entomology. The concept of forensic entomology dates back to at least the 13th century. However, only in the last 30 years has forensic entomology been systematically explored as a feasible source for evidence in criminal investigations. Through their own experiments and interest in arthropods and death, Sung Tzu, Francesco Redi, Bergeret d’Arbois, Jean Pierre Mégnin and the physiologist Hermann Reinhard have helped to lay the foundations for today's modern forensic entomology. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"The grey-fronted honeyeater (Ptilotula plumula) is a species of bird in the family Meliphagidae. It is endemic to Australia. Its natural habitat is Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation. The grey-fronted honeyeater was originally described in 1841 by English ornithologist John Gould as Lichenostomus plumulus. It was moved to the genus Ptilotula after a molecular phylogenetic analysis, published in 2011, showed that Lichenostomus was polyphyletic. Description The grey-fronted honeyeater is a small, plain honeyeater with a yellow neck plume bordered above by black. It has a small grey patch at the forehead, that may be obscure in northern subspecies. The crown is olive yellow and the lores blackish. The upper parts are olive grey and flight feathers yellow olive. Underparts are off white with indistinct stripes. The grey-fronted honeyeater can easily be confused with the yellow-tinted honeyeater as their ranges overlap and they are of similar size.

The genus Cananeuretus was first described by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1875. The type species is C. montanus, which is known from a single specimen discovered in the Clovis Formation of New Mexico. The genus is known from a total of six specimens, all of which are from the Clovis Formation. All six specimens are preserved as complete and articulated skeletons.

In general, green personality types are independent thinkers, gold personality types are pragmatic planners, orange personality types are very action-oriented, and blue personality types are very people-oriented. The idea behind True Colors is that it does not pigeonhole people into one personality type over another with the understanding that one's personality might make adjustments based on his or her environment or associations.

{"prompt":"Judicial murder is the intentional and premeditated killing of an innocent person by means of capital punishment; therefore, it is a subset of wrongful execution. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as \"death inflicted by process of law, capital punishment, esp. considered to be unjust or cruel\". Example An early case in which charges of judicial murder were raised was the Amboyna massacre in 1623, which caused a legal dispute between the English and Dutch governments over the conduct of a court in the Dutch East Indies that had ordered the execution of ten English men accused of treason. The dispute centered around differing interpretations of the legal jurisdiction of the court in question. The English believed that this court had not been competent to try and execute these EIC members, and so believed the executions to have been fundamentally illegal, thus constituting \"judicial murder\". The Dutch, on the other hand, believed the court to have been fundamentally competent, and wished to focus instead on misconduct of the particular judges in the court. ->","completion":" 1"}

The first Turks to arrive in Norway were traders and merchants who came to Norway during the late Middle Ages. The first recorded Turkish immigrant to arrive in Norway was Süleyman Çelebi, a merchant from the Ottoman Empire who settled in Bergen in 1525. Others followed suit and by the end of the 16th century, there were around 50 Turkish immigrants living in Norway.

Walter Cannon and his work In 1942, Walter Bradford Cannon, MD, now looked to as a forerunner in modern physiological psychology, published a work wherein he postulated the idea that fear could affect a person to the point that their physical condition would deteriorate in response to psychological distress. Citing examples of extraordinary deaths (and their extraneous circumstances) in aboriginal societies, Cannon posited the idea that fear of supernatural consequences to broken societal taboos caused the deaths witnessed in the natives. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"\"Anymore\" is a song performed by English group Goldfrapp from their seventh studio album Silver Eye (2017). It was released as a CD single and digital download on 23 January 2017 through Mute Records. The song was written and produced by Alison Goldfrapp and William Owen Gregory, with additional production coming from The Haxan Cloak and John Congleton. The song incorporates several genres, including dance-pop, electronica and synth-pop, and takes influence from disco and glitch music. Critics noticed similarities between \"Anymore\" and the music from their 2003 album Black Cherry.

Critically, \"Anymore\" drew a generally positive response from music critics. Several reviewers noted the strength of the single as an album opener on Silver Eye. However, some critics found the track to be mediocre when compared with Goldfrapp's previous material.

{"prompt":"Although elements of fashion design copyright may be traced in Europe to as early as the 15th century, as of 2016 most countries (including the United States and the United Kingdom) fashion design does not have the same protection as other creative works (art, film, literature, etc.), because apparel (clothes, shoes, handbags, etc.) are classified as \"functional items\", excluded from protection by copyright laws. This explains the success of the knockoff businesses to the detriment of both the established labels, as well as of emerging designers, the latter ones being especially damaged, because they rely on relatively few designs. History French king Francis I gave out specific privileges related to the production of textiles. By 1711, in Lyon, illegalities were already being defined in regards to fashion materials, and in 1787, in England and Scotland fashion designers had fruitfully pushed their needs for protection into basic legislation. In 1876 Germany began protecting fashion patterns as well as models, and in 2002 European regulation on designs that were new and provided an aspect of fresh character or aesthetic were brought under protection. From 2004 to 2006 the \"total production volume for clothing decreased by about 5% each year... [and by] 2006 the European union trade deficit for clothing was at 33.7 billion.\" These statistics show that while there are benefits of their advanced design legislation, the economic and external factors still hindered their industry growth in ways the U.S. can empathize with. As 2007 came to a close, WIPO, or the World Intellectual Property Organization, had registered twenty-nine international designs. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"American urban history is the study of cities of the United States. Local historians have always written about their own cities. Starting in the 1920s, and led by Arthur Schlesinger, Sr. at Harvard, professional historians began comparative analysis of what cities have in common, and started using theoretical models and scholarly biographies of specific cities. The United States has also had a long history of hostility to the city, as characterized for example by Thomas Jefferson's agrarianism and the Populist movement of the 1890s. Mary Sies (2003) argues: Historiography  American urban history is a branch of the history of the United States and of the broader field of Urban history. That field of history examines the historical development of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like social history, architectural history, urban sociology, urban geography business history, and even archaeology. Urbanization and industrialization were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of modernization, or the transformation of rural traditional societies. ->","completion":" 1"}

The VF-84 Jolly Rogers (1955–95) are the main topic of this article.

He was born near Lake Rotorua, New Zealand, probably in 1845 or 1846. His father, Hēmana Te Whareiro of Ngāti Wāhiao, lived mostly at Whakarewarewa. His mother, Kanea II, was of Tūhourangi, and the Ngāti Tūnohopū hapū of Ngāti Whakaue. In 1864 Mita joined other Te Arawa who fought for the government in the wars of the 1860s. He returned to Whakarewarewa in 1874. In 1883 he represented several hapū of Ngāti Wāhiao in the Native Land Court in a case relating to land claimed by Ngāti Whakaue, including Whakarewarewa, and succeeded in claims to the land on the east side of the Puarenga Stream at Whakarewarewa, although other land was won by Ngāti Whakaue. His success in the land court contributed to a recognition of his leadership among the wider Tūhourangi, in addition to within Ngāti Wāhiao. The 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera killed many Tūhourangi, and survivors took refuge with Mita and his people at Whakarewarewa and Ōhinemutu. Mita continued to act in the Native Land Court, representing Tūhourangi, and in 1887 won recognition of their claims of the 211,000-acre Rotomahana–Parekārangi block.

{"prompt":"Discant, or descant (descant), (, meaning \"singing apart\") originated as a style of liturgical setting in the Middle Ages, associated with the development of the Notre Dame school of polyphony. In origin, it is a style of organum that either includes a plainchant tenor part (usually on a melisma in the chant) or is used without a plainchant basis in conductus, in either case with a \"note against note\" upper voice, moving in contrary motion. It is not a musical form, but rather a technique. The term continued to be used down to modern times with changing senses, at first for polyphony in general, then to differentiate a subcategory of polyphony (either in contrast to organum, or for improvised as distinct from written polyphony). By extension it became the name of a part that is added above the tenor, and later as the name of the highest part in a polyphonic setting (the equivalent of \"cantus\", \"superius\", and \"soprano\"). Finally, it was adopted as the name of the highest register of instruments such as recorders, cornets, viols, and organ stops. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"Cleanliness is both the abstract state of being clean and free from germs, dirt, trash, or waste, and the habit of achieving and maintaining that state. Cleanliness is often achieved through cleaning. Culturally, cleanliness is usually a good quality, as indicated by the aphorism: \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\", and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as health and beauty. In emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention, the concept of cleanliness differs from purity, which is a physical, moral, or ritual state of freedom from pollutants. Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance, cleanliness has a social dimension and direction or implies a system of interactions. \"Cleanliness,\" observed Jacob Burckhardt, \"is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection.\" A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness, but not ordinarily purity; cleanliness also would be a characteristic of the people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying. ->","completion":" 1"}

Fundamental analysis is one of the five main financial analysis methods. It is also one of the six investment analysis methods.

The fundamental analysis process involves examining a company's financial statements and trends to gain an understanding of its underlying business. The most important part of a company's financial statement is its income statement. The income statement tells you how much money a company made in total during a given period of time (e.g., the past quarter).

Discovery and naming The fossils of Auroroborealia were discovered by a joint expedition of the Geological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Trofimuk Institute of Petroleum Geology and Geophysics, Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, during excavations in 2006 and 2009. These expeditions yielded a variety of ichthyosaurian remains from six stratigraphic levels ranging from the lower Carnian to middle Norian. Although most specimens were fragmentary, Zverkov et al. (2021) could nevertheless differentiate between a host of different ichthyosaurs. One fossil in particular, specimen ZIN PH 5\/250, included cranial remains as well as anterior presacral vertebrae with associated neural arches and ribs. A bone fragment associated with the pectoral girdle is also part of this specimen. Based on this material Zverkov et al. erected the species Aurororborealia incognita, while also describing a series of referred specimens (which however did not factor into the diagnosis of the genus). ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"The Barony of Chalandritsa was a medieval Frankish fiefdom of the Principality of Achaea, located in the northern Peloponnese peninsula in Greece, and centred on the town of Chalandritsa (; ; ; Aragonese: C[h]alandrica) south of Patras. History The Barony of Chalandritsa was established ca. 1209, after the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Crusaders, and was one of the original twelve secular baronies within the Principality of Achaea. The barony was one of the smallest, with four knight's fiefs attached to it. The first baron was G. (probably Guy) of Dramelay (or Trimolay, Tremolay) from the namesake village in Burgundy, who is attested in the 1209 Treaty of Sapienza. Many older histories, following Jean Alexandre Buchon and Karl Hopf, have Audebert de la Trémouille as the first baron. His successor, Robert of Dramelay, is attested ca. 1230. It was he who built the castle of Chalandritsa according to the Greek and Italian versions of the Chronicle of the Morea. The Aragonese version of the Chronicle on the other hand reports a completely different story, according to which the castle of Chalandritsa had been built by Conrad of Aleman, Baron of Patras, and that it and other lands, comprising eight knight's fiefs, were purchased around 1259 by Prince William II of Villehardouin and given to a knight named Guy of Dramelay, who had only recently arrived in the Morea.

{"prompt":"Haitian Vodou is an African diasporic religion that developed in Haiti between the 16th and 19th centuries. It arose through a process of syncretism between several traditional religions of West and Central Africa and the Roman Catholic form of Christianity. There is no central authority in control of the religion and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Vodouists, Vodouisants, or Serviteurs. Vodou revolves around spirits known as lwa. Typically deriving their names and attributes from traditional West and Central African divinities, they are equated with Roman Catholic saints. The lwa divide up into different groups, the nanchon (\"nations\"), most notably the Rada and the Petwo. Various myths and stories are told about these lwa, which are regarded as subservient to a transcendent creator deity, Bondye. This theology has been labelled both monotheistic and polytheistic. An initiatory tradition, Vodouists usually meet to venerate the lwa in an ounfò (temple), run by an oungan (priest) or manbo (priestess). A central ritual involves practitioners drumming, singing, and dancing to encourage a lwa to possess one of their members and thus communicate with them. Offerings to the lwa include fruit, liquor, and sacrificed animals. Offerings are also given to the spirits of the dead. Several forms of divination are utilized to decipher messages from the lwa. Healing rituals and the preparation of herbal remedies and talismans also play a prominent role. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"Casuistry is a process of reasoning by which judges, lawyers and other legal professionals try to reach just conclusions in cases. Casuistry can be used to justify any decision, even if the legal principle underlying it is invalid. Casuists may also use casuistry to deceive their opponents or clients. Casuistry is a key feature of the medieval judicial process, which was based on the principle of \"lex talionis\" or \"an eye for an eye\". This meant that people were expected to take revenge for wrongs done to them. As a result, casuistry developed as a way of justifying decisions based on this principle without actually doing anything. For example, if someone had been hurt by another person, the casuist might try to argue that the other person should be punished in exactly the same way. This was known as \"strict liability\". In more recent times, casuistry has been used more often to deceive people. For example, a lawyer might argue that a particular law is unconstitutional in order to get their client off the hook. Casuistry can also be used to justify unjustified actions by authorities. For example, during the Nazi concentration camps, Nazis often used casuistry to argue that prisoners were being punished for crimes they hadn't committed. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Openness to experience is one of the domains which are used to describe human personality in the Five Factor Model. Openness involves six facets, or dimensions: active imagination (fantasy), aesthetic sensitivity, attentiveness to inner feelings, preference for variety (adventurousness), intellectual curiosity, and challenging authority (psychological liberalism). A great deal of psychometric research has demonstrated that these facets or qualities are significantly correlated. Thus, openness can be viewed as a global personality trait consisting of a set of specific traits, habits, and tendencies that cluster together. Openness tends to be normally distributed with a small number of individuals scoring extremely high or low on the trait, and most people scoring moderately. People who score low on openness are considered to be closed to experience. They tend to be conventional and traditional in their outlook and behavior. They prefer familiar routines to new experiences, and generally have a narrower range of interests. Openness has moderate positive relationships with creativity, intelligence and knowledge. Openness is related to the psychological trait of absorption, and like absorption has a modest relationship to individual differences in hypnotic susceptibility. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"The Bliss bibliographic classification (BC) is a library classification system that was created by Henry E. Bliss (1870–1955) and published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953. Although originally devised in the United States, it was more commonly adopted by British libraries. A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977. Origins of the system Henry E. Bliss began working on the Bliss Classification system while working at the City College of New York Library as Assistant Librarian. He was a critic of Melvil Dewey's work with the Dewey Decimal System and believed that organization of titles needed to be done with an intellectual mind frame. Being overly pragmatic or simply alphabetical, would be inadequate. In fact, Bliss is the only theorist who created an organizational scheme based on societal needs. Bliss wanted a classification system that would provide distinct rules yet still be adaptable to whatever kind of collection a library might have, as different libraries have different needs. His solution was the concept of \"alternative location,\" in which a particular subject could be put in more than one place, as long as the library made a specific choice and used it consistently. ->","completion":" 1"}

Serra's sculptures are notable for their material quality and exploration of the relationship between the viewer, the work, and the site. Since the mid-1960s, Serra has worked to radicalize and extend the definition of sculpture beginning with his early experiments with rubber, neon, and lead, to his large-scale steel works. Early life and education Serra was born in San Francisco, California to Tony and Gladys Serra – the second of three sons. From a young age, he was encouraged to draw by his mother.

{"prompt":"Kongonaphon is an extinct genus of lagerpetid avemetatarsalians from the Middle to Late Triassic of Madagascar. It contains a single species, Kongonaphon kely, which is known from a fragmentary partial skeleton. This fossil hails from the late Ladinian or early Carnian-age \"basal Isalo II beds\". As the first lagerpetid found in Africa, Kongonaphon extends the range of the family significantly. It possessed a combination of features from various other lagerpetids, but developed particularly long and slender leg bones. Kongonaphon is also the first lagerpetid for which fossils of the snout and teeth are known. It was likely an insectivore based on the shape and texture of its teeth. Kongonaphon is notable for its minuscule size, even compared to other small early avemetatarsalians. The proportionally elongated femur was only about 4 cm (1.6 inches) long, and the total height of the animal was estimated at around 10 cm (3.9 inches). Alongside other miniaturized archosaurs such as Scleromochlus, it suggests that avemetatarsalians experienced an abrupt reduction in size early in their evolution. This may explain the poor preservation and scarcity of early and middle Triassic avemetatarsalian fossils. A small size also may have helped them exploit a variety of new ecological niches. The most successful avemetatarsalian subgroups, pterosaurs and dinosaurs, may have evolved as a result of this abrupt size reduction. Miniaturization has been correlated with the evolution of flight (a defining feature of pterosaurs) and the acquisition of bipedalism (which was utilized by many dinosaurs). It would also lead to poor heat retention, encouraging the evolution of feathers or other filamentous structures. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"The Comanche Wars were a series of armed conflicts fought between Comanche peoples and Spanish, Mexican, and American militaries and civilians in the United States and Mexico from as early as 1706 until at least the mid-1870s. The Comanche were the Native American inhabitants of a large area known as Comancheria, which stretched across much of the southern Great Plains from Colorado and Kansas in the north through Oklahoma, Texas, and eastern New Mexico and into the Mexican state of Chihuahua in the south. For more than 150 years, the Comanche were the dominant native tribe in the region, known as “the Lords of the Southern Plains”, though they also shared parts of Comancheria with the Wichita, Kiowa, and Kiowa Apache and, after 1840, the southern Cheyenne and Arapaho. The value of the Comanche traditional homeland was recognized by European-American colonists seeking to settle the American frontier and quickly brought the two sides into conflict. The Comanche Wars began in 1706 with raids by Comanche warriors on the Spanish colonies of New Spain and continued until the last bands of Comanche surrendered to the United States Army in 1875, although a few Comanche continued to fight in later conflicts such as the Buffalo Hunters' War in 1876 and 1877.

{"prompt":"Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied considerably throughout history. In some societies, same-sex relationships are considered immoral, while in others they are seen as natural and even necessary. Throughout the course of human history, there have been many notable people who have been in same-sex relationships, including philosophers, politicians, and artists. The origins of homosexuality are difficult to discern, as there is no single point at which it first began to be accepted as a sexual orientation. Some historians suggest that it may have arisen from the necessity for homosexual individuals to band together in order to protect themselves from violence or persecution. Others believe that it may have developed as a result of the repression and discrimination that homosexuals have faced throughout history. Regardless of its origins, homosexuality has always been a controversial subject. Many people view it as immoral, while others see it as a natural expression of love. Throughout history, same-sex relationships have been met with varying degrees of acceptance, ranging from total condemnation to legal recognition. Today, most countries have laws that protect homosexuals from discrimination, but there is still much work to be done in terms of fully understanding and accepting homosexuality as a valid form of sexuality ->","completion":" 0"}

The player can also use objects to help them navigate their way through the levels, such as ramps or swinging platforms. Levels are designed to be replayable, with different obstacles and layouts available on each playthrough. Sprung is based on the Parc Astérix amusement park in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France. The game's development began in early 2017 after Ubisoft commissioned Playlogic to create a new IP for the company's PixARK video gaming platform. Playlogic aimed to create a fun and accessible platformer that would appeal to both children and adults, based on its own experiences playing video games as a child. The development team worked with park personnel to ensure accurate recreations of the amusement park's features and elements.  ->","completion":" 0"}

Players must cooperate to allocate water resources among crops, and make strategic decisions about which crops to water, when to water them, and how much water to supply.

{"prompt":"Federal common law is a term of United States law used to describe common law that is developed by the federal courts, instead of by the courts of the various states. The United States is the only country to combine the creation of common law doctrines with a complete federalism, wherein the national supreme court has virtually no power to review state court decisions to determine whether the state courts have followed state laws. The High Court of Australia is sometimes said to have federal common law, but because all state and territorial courts are directly appealable to the High Court, this is indistinguishable from a general common law. In contrast, the United States Supreme Court has effectively barred the creation of federal common law in areas traditionally under the authority of state courts. Nevertheless, there are several areas where federal common law continues to govern. The Swift doctrine Until 1938, federal courts in America followed the doctrine set forth in the 1842 case of Swift v. Tyson. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts hearing cases brought under their diversity jurisdiction (allowing them to hear cases between parties from different U.S. states) had to apply the statutory law of the states, but not the common law developed by state courts. Instead, the Supreme Court permitted the federal courts to make their own common law based on general principles of law. ->","completion":" 1"}

Band history Wizard formed in spring 1970 at the University of South Florida when singer and bassist Paul Forney and guitarist Ben Schultz met through a mutual friend, jammed together and formed a short-lived rock trio, Brother. Prior to their first gig, their drummer walked out on soundcheck and was promptly replaced by roadie Chris Luhn, who proved to be a competent instrumentalist. The new band changed their name to Wizard. The band was touring in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Michigan, and Illinois, opening for Iron Butterfly, Chicago, Mountain, and Rod Stewart, among others. At the Goose Lake Festival, outside Detroit, they caught attention of Decca Records' Bob Fletcher who took the group to Atlanta's LeFevre Sound Studiosfor a recording session. As a result, The Original Wizard, the band's first and only album, released in 1971 on Peon Records. Wizard continued to perform, including a gig the next winter at an indoor festival at the Hollywood Fairgrounds in Florida, but not for long: sixteen months after forming, the band called it quits. ->","completion":" 1"}

He served as Tombstone, Arizona's Special Policeman when he helped his brothers Virgil and Wyatt, as well as Doc Holliday, confront the outlaw Cochise County Cowboys in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881. All three Earp brothers had been the target of repeated death threats made by the Cowboys who were upset by the Earps' interference in their illegal activities. The lawmen killed Cowboys Tom and Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton. All four lawmen were charged with murder by Billy's older brother, Ike Clanton, who had run from the gunfight.

{"prompt":"The general classification (or the GC) in cycling is a ranking system used to determine the overall placing of cyclists in a race. The system is based on the finishing times of the cyclists in a race, with the first cyclist across the line receiving a ranking of 1, the second cyclist 2 etc., up to the cyclist who finishes last, who receives a ranking of 10. The GC was first introduced in 1903 by Jules Durand, and was originally a system for determining the order of cyclists in a race. The system was based on the number of minutes that each cyclist had been leading at the end of the race. However, this system was not very accurate, and it was not until 1912 that the GC was changed to its current form. The GC is one of the most important rankings in cycling, and is often used to determine which riders will be selected for major races. For example, if there is a major race that has a number of riders who are qualified for qualification based on their GC ranking, then the riders who are ranked first through fourth will be selected for qualification. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Shaving is the removal of hair, by cutting it with a blade or other instrument. The term can refer to the act of shaving as well as the equipment used for shaving. Shaving is an ancient practice that has been around for thousands of years. It is thought to have originated in Egypt and was used by Pharaohs as a form of hygiene. Early shaving techniques involved using sandpaper to remove hair, but this was eventually replaced by blades. Blades are still the most common method of shaving today, although there are now also electric and wet shaving products available. Shaving can be done with either a straight razor or a safety razor. Straight razors are more expensive, but they are more difficult to use and require more skill. Safety razors are easier to use, but they can be less sharp and may cause nicks and cuts. Both types of razor produce a similar result, though straight razors are generally considered to be more aesthetically pleasing. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Bass–Serre theory is a part of the mathematical subject of group theory that deals with analyzing the algebraic structure of groups acting by automorphisms on simplicial trees. The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of free product with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass–Serre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory. History Bass–Serre theory was developed by Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970s and formalized in Trees, Serre's 1977 monograph (developed in collaboration with Hyman Bass) on the subject. Serre's original motivation was to understand the structure of certain algebraic groups whose Bruhat–Tits buildings are trees. However, the theory quickly became a standard tool of geometric group theory and geometric topology, particularly the study of 3-manifolds. Subsequent work of Bass contributed substantially to the formalization and development of basic tools of the theory and currently the term \"Bass–Serre theory\" is widely used to describe the subject. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"In Spanish towns and cities, the Policia Municipal (municipal police) is a corps of law enforcement officers responsible for the security of public areas and the prevention and detection of crime. The municipal police are divided into two main categories: the uniformed patrol officers, who patrol on foot and in vehicles, and the forensic experts. The origins of municipal policing in Spain can be traced back to the early days of the country's modern history. In 1833, King Fernando VII created the Guardia Civil, a national police force that was exclusively composed of soldiers from the Spanish army. The municipal police were initially tasked with providing security for Spanish cities, but they gradually began to assume additional responsibilities, such as frontier policing and public order management. Municipal policing underwent a significant transformation in the late 20th century, when law enforcement agencies began to adopt a more proactive approach to crime prevention. This shift led to the development of specialized units such as the Policia Urbana (urban police), which are responsible for addressing crime problems in urban areas. Today, municipal policing plays an important role in protecting public safety in Spanish towns and cities. ->","completion":" 0"}

They may make false claims about the amount of money that their organization has raised or the use that it has made of the funds. They may falsify documents to make it appear as if the organization is more effective than it actually is. Or they may simply steal money from donors by pretending to spend it on charitable purposes when in fact they are spending it on themselves. Whatever form it takes, charity fraud is a criminal offense that should be avoided at all costs. If you are suspicious about any activity that your charity is involved in, please do not hesitate to contact your local police department or the charity's own audit department. In many cases, swift action by the authorities will be enough to put a stop to any wrongdoing and protect the charity's reputation and donors' money ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Theriophily (or animalitarianism) is \"the inversion of the basic human instincts of self-preservation and procreation, whereby an individual seeks to cause or encourage the death of another creature in order to gratify their own desires or satisfy their curiosity.\" Theriophily is a strange and unusual form of behavior that some animals display that has no obvious benefit to themselves. Rather, it is motivated by a desire to cause or encourage the death of another creature, often for the pleasure or curiosity it brings. This strange inclination can be found in a wide variety of creatures, from spiders to lions, and it has been observed in both predators and prey. Although theriophily may seem morbid or even evil, it is actually widespread and appears to have evolutionary benefits. In some cases, theriophily can help an animal survive by securing food or prey that would otherwise be unavailable, and it can also serve as a form of social communication. Despite its unusual nature, theriophily is fascinating and worthy of further study. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Figure-ground contrast, in the context of map design, is a property of a map in which the map image can be partitioned into a single feature or type of feature that is considered as an object of attention (the figure), with the remainder of the map being relegated to the background, outside the current focus of attention. It is thus based on the concept of figure–ground from Gestalt psychology. For example, in a street map with strong figure-ground contrast, the reader would be able to isolate and focus attention on individual features, like a given street, park, or lake, as well as layers of related features, like the street network. Strong figure-ground contrast has been seen as a desirable goal of map design, because it helps the map reader to perceive distinct geographic phenomena in the map. This allows more complex composition techniques such as visual hierarchy to organize these phenomena into clear structures that help readers use the map for its intended purposes. ->","completion":" 1"}
{"prompt":"In coding theory, a linear code is a certain type of code that can be used for error-correcting and redundancy-free communication. Linear codes are also called error-correcting codes, block codes, or convolutional codes. Linear codes are used in a variety of applications, such as data communication and storage, machine learning and decoding, computer security, and biomedical data analysis. Linear codes are also of particular interest to researchers working on quantum cryptography and secure communications. A linear code is a code that can be used to communicate errors between two parties. The two parties use a codebook to map each symbol in the code to a corresponding symbol in the other party's codebook. If one of the parties detects an error, they can use their codebook to find the correct symbol in the other party's codebook and send them the correct symbol. Linear codes are composed of codewords (strings of symbols). Each codeword is divided into blocks (groups of consecutive symbols). A block is broken down into symbols (individual symbols). A symbol is either a letter or a number. To encode a message using a linear code, you first choose a codeword for your message. You then create a codebook that contains all the possible symbols you could possibly use for that codeword. You then map each symbol in your message to a corresponding symbol in your codebook. Finally, you encode your message using the symbols in your codebook. To decode ->","completion":" 0"}

Impressed with the location, he bought some land from a fellow whose last name was Williams(W. W. Williams) decided to stay and established a ranch on the springs.

{"prompt":"Diplomatic immunity is a form of legal protection afforded to diplomats, consular personnel, and their families from the jurisdiction of local courts. This immunity is a principle of international law, codified in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Diplomatic immunity allows diplomats to conduct their duties without fear of personal jurisdiction or legal action by local authorities. It is most frequently extended to diplomats serving in foreign embassies and consulates, but can also be granted to diplomats serving in a host country's capital city. In some cases, diplomatic immunity may also cover staff of international organizations such as the United Nations. The doctrine of diplomatic immunity has been extended to cover personnel from private international organizations such as the Red Cross. While not formally protected by law, private international organizations often enjoy a degree of immunity from local jurisdiction in order to encourage their participation in humanitarian relief efforts. While diplomatic immunity is an important aspect of international relations, it can also be abused by diplomats who are unwilling or unable to follow local laws. This has led to calls for the doctrine of diplomatic immunity to be reformed or eliminated altogether. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"BAS (belted alternator starter) is a category of automotive parallel hybrid technology that uses an electric motor to contribute power to the internal combustion engine's crankshaft via a serpentine belt. By mounting this motor generator unit in the conventional location traditionally used for the standard automotive alternator, it permits a low-cost method of adding mild hybrid capabilities such as start-stop, power assist, and mild levels of regenerative braking. BAS differ from other mild hybrid systems as they are not run off the vehicle's crankshaft. Generation I BAS General Motors introduced a mild hybrid system called belt alternator starter (BAS) in the 2007 Saturn Vue Green Line. The BAS system is also used in the 2008–2009 Chevrolet Malibu Hybrid.

{"prompt":"Fra Bartolomeo or Bartolommeo (, , ; 28 March 1472 – 31 October 1517), also known as Bartolommeo di Pagholo, Bartolommeo di S. Marco, and his original nickname Baccio della Porta, was an Italian Renaissance painter of religious subjects. He spent all his career in Florence until his mid-forties, when he travelled to work in various cities, as far south as Rome. He trained with Cosimo Roselli and in the 1490s fell under the influence of Savonarola, which led him to become a Dominican friar in 1500, renouncing painting for several years. Typically his paintings are of static groups of figures in subjects such as the Virgin and Child with Saints. He was instructed to resume painting for the benefit of his order in 1504, and then developed an idealized High Renaissance style, seen in his Vision of St Bernard of that year, now in poor condition but whose \"figures and drapery move with a seraphic grace that must have struck the young Raphael with the force of revelation\".

{"prompt":"In molecular biology, the glutaredoxin 2 family is a family of bacterial glutaredoxins. Unlike other glutaredoxins, glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2) cannot reduce ribonucleotide reductase. Grx2 has significantly higher catalytic activity in the reduction of mixed disulphides with glutathione (GSH) compared with other glutaredoxins. The active site residues (Cys9-Pro10-Tyr11-Cys12, in Escherichia coli Grx2, which are found at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains are identical to other glutaredoxins, but there is no other similarity between glutaredoxin 2 and other glutaredoxins. Grx2 is structurally similar to glutathione-S-transferases (GST), but there is no obvious sequence similarity. The inter-domain contacts are mainly hydrophobic, suggesting that the two domains are unlikely to be stable on their own. Both domains are needed for correct folding and activity of Grx2. It is thought that the primary function of Grx2 is to catalyse reversible glutathionylation of proteins with GSH in cellular redox regulation including the response to oxidative stress. These enzymes are not related to GLRX2. References ->","completion":" 1"}

Moreover, Arab identity is often intertwined with religious and political affiliations. The definition of Arab identity has been a source of contention for many Arabs, and has been a central topic of debate in the Arab world. Some Arabs see their identity as a unifying force that can help unite the Arab world against external threats, while others view their identity as a source of division that can lead to sectarianism and conflict. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"Liberal Christianity, also known as liberal theology, is a theological movement within Protestant Christianity that stresses the importance of individual liberty and freedom of conscience. It is sometimes considered synonymous with the mainline Protestant denominations, though it also has adherents in other traditions. Liberal Christianity began to emerge in the late eighteenth century as a reaction against traditional Protestantism. The leaders of this movement believed that the doctrines of predestination and election were antithetical to human freedom and equality, and that the sacraments should be viewed merely as symbols of grace rather than as means of salvation. They also believed that the Bible should be read without comment or interpretation, and that biblical morality should be applied without regard to social customs or economic conditions. Today, liberal Christianity is represented by a variety of religious denominations and groups. It is strongest among Protestant denominations in North America and Europe, but has also adherents among Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and members of other religious traditions. Liberal Christianity has played an important role in the development of critical thinking and religious pluralism within Protestantism, and has helped to foster relationships between different religious groups. ->","completion":" 0"}

{"prompt":"The Rolls-Royce Merlin is a British liquid-cooled V-12 piston aero engine of 27-litres (1,650 cu in) capacity. Rolls-Royce designed the engine and first ran it in 1933 as a private venture. Initially known as the PV-12, it was later called Merlin following the company convention of naming its four-stroke piston aero engines after birds of prey. After several modifications, the first production variants of the PV-12 were completed in 1936. The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle, Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire. The Merlin remains most closely associated with the Spitfire and Hurricane, although the majority of the production run was for the four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber. A series of rapidly-applied developments, brought about by wartime needs, markedly improved the engine's performance and durability. Starting at 1,000 hp for the first production models, most late war versions produced just under 1,800 hp, and the very latest version as used in the de Havilland Hornet over 2,000 hp. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"The cognitive reflection test (CRT) is a task designed to measure a person's tendency to override an incorrect \"gut\" response and engage in further reflection to find a correct answer; however, the validity of the assessment as a measure of \"cognitive reflection\" or \"intuitive thinking\" is under question. It was first described in 2005 by psychologist Shane Frederick. The CRT has a moderate positive correlation with measures of intelligence, such as the Intelligence Quotient test, and it correlates highly with various measures of mental heuristics. Some research argue that the CRT is actually measuring cognitive abilities (colloquially known as intelligence). Later research showed that the CRT is a multifaceted construct: many start their response with the correct answer, while others fail to solve the test even if they reflect on their intuitive first answer. It has also been argued that suppression of the first answer is not the only factor behind the successful performance on the CRT: numeracy and reflectivity both account for performance. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"A yeshiva (; ; pl. , yeshivas, also yeshivos, yeshivas plural) is a Jewish educational institution, typically an elementary or secondary school or college, with a focus on the study of the Torah.

The term yeshiva is also used to describe the students of these schools. The first recorded use of the word yeshiva in English was in 1819,[2] and it has been used in that sense ever since. In rabbinic literature, the term generally refers to any school that offers instruction in Torah.[3] A common misconception is that the term refers exclusively to institutions of higher education.

The system consisted of up to twenty symbols, each of which represented one of the 20 units in the Muisca decimal system. The Muisca were a people who lived in the highlands of present-day Colombia during the Early Pre-Columbian period. They were one of the most important cultural and linguistic groups in South America, and their numerals were one of the most complex and advanced systems used in the region. The Muisca numerals were based on a vigesimal system, using 20 symbols to represent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500.

Neomercantilism is the dominant school of thought in mainstream economics, which holds that increasing exports and creating a trade surplus is the key to sustained economic growth. The theory has been discredited by many economists, who argue that it is not always feasible to increase exports, and that trying to do so can lead to trade wars and other harmful consequences. The term \"neo-mercantilism\" was first used in the 1930s by economist Joseph Schumpeter to describe the policy of governments during the Great Depression of trying to increase exports to revive their economies.

The entrance to the site is located on Iona Road, approximately three kilometres south of Iona Ontario, Canada. A double oval ring of raised earthworks surrounds the remains of the village. Background Occupied between AD 1450 and 1550, it is located in southwestern Ontario in rural Elgin County, near the banks of a tributary of Talbot Creek, approximately 20 km west of St. Thomas, Ontario. Archaeological investigations have indicated the presence at one time of eighteen longhouses of various sizes within the village, with an estimated population of 800-900 people. These native inhabitants were the Attiwandaronk (Attarawandon) Indians, an Iroquoian-speaking people called the Neutrals by the French colonists. An open area in the centre of the community appears to have provided a common activity area or meeting place. The archaeological interpretation concludes that Southwold was a typical pre-contact Neutral village, palisaded for defensive purposes.  ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"The parieto-frontal integration theory (P-FIT) considers intelligence to relate to how well different brain regions integrate to form intelligent behaviors. The theory proposes that large scale brain networks connect brain regions, including regions within frontal, parietal, temporal, and cingulate cortices, underlie the biological basis of human intelligence. These regions, which overlap significantly with the task-positive network, allow the brain to communicate and exchange information efficiently with one another. Support for this theory is primarily based on neuroimaging evidence, with support from lesion studies. The P-FIT is influential in that it explains the majority of current neuroimaging findings, as well as increasing empirical support for cognition being the result of large-scale brain networks, rather than numerous domain-specific processes or modules. A 2010 review of the neuroscience of intelligence described P-FIT as \"the best available answer to the question of where in the brain intelligence resides\". The theory General intelligence requires specific brain regions and incorporates: Sensory processing, primarily in the visual and auditory modalities, including specific temporal and parietal areas Sensory abstracting and elaboration by the parietal cortex (especially the supramarginal, superior parietal, and angular gyri) Interaction between the parietal cortex and frontal lobes for hypothesis testing available solutions Response selection and inhibition of competing responses by the anterior cingulate ->","completion":" 1"}

After his death in 1975, Spain transitioned into a democracy. During this time period Spain was officially known as the Spanish State . The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence. Months after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed head of state on 1 April 1939, ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction. The 1937 Unification Decree, which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as \"fascistized dictatorship\", or \"semi-fascist regime\", showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations, the autarkic economic policy, aesthetics, and the single-party system.

The site lies some north of the major center of Tikal. The name is sometimes spelled as Waxaktun. History of discovery With recent achievements in the decipherment of the ancient Maya hieroglyphic writing system, it has been determined that the ancient name for this site translates roughly as Siaan K'aan or \"Born in Heaven\". The name Uaxactun was given to the site by its rediscoverer, archaeologist Sylvanus Morley, in May 1916. He coined the name from Maya words Waxac and Tun, to mean \"Eight Stones\". The name has two meanings; Morley's stated reason for the name was to commemorate it as the first site where an inscription dating from the 8th Baktún of the Maya calendar was discovered (making it then the earliest known Maya date). The other meaning is a pun, since \"Uaxactun\" sounds like \"Washington\", the U.S. capital and home of the Carnegie Institute which funded Morley's explorations. ->","completion":" 1"}

{"prompt":"The Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy is a major schism in the history of Christianity, with Fundamentalist Christians defending the traditional view of the Bible against Modernists who argued that the Bible should be read in light of current scientific and historical knowledge. The Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy emerged in the early 20th century as a battle between two schools of thought within Christianity: Fundamentalists, who defended traditional interpretations of the Bible, and Modernists, who argued that the Bible should be read in light of current scientific and historical knowledge. The debate intensified in 1925 when Christian theologian Reinhold Niebuhr published his book The Nature and Destiny of Man, which attacked traditional Protestant doctrines in favor of a synthesis of Christianity and secular philosophy. The Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy reached a critical point in 1948 when the General Assembly of the World Council of Churches met in Amsterdam to discuss the issue. There, Modernists gained a majority and passed a resolution calling for a reconsideration of the Bible's teachings on science, history, and other subjects. This resolution led to a decline in membership in mainline Protestant churches, which were now perceived as being too aligned with Modernism. The Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy has largely subsided since then, but it remains a significant issue within Christianity. Today, there are still some Fundamentalists who defend traditional interpretations of the Bible against Modernists, but the majority of Christians have moved away from the Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy and have adopted a more moderate stance. ->","completion":" 0"}

Goojje, founded on January 14, 2010 also allows searches to be run, but apparently uses Google and Baidu to do the actual searches. Google has demanded that Goojje stop using its logo, but Goojje refused until 2011. ->","completion":" 1"}
